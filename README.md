Built with Wordpress PHP
Deployed with SiteGround & DeployHQ

Some wins 

- successfully created custom post types & custom fields via ACF plugin
- successfully wrote wp queries to template out related post types
- a better grasp of Wordpress architecture (housing data within Wordpress, templating with various types of page/post types), crediting my prior knowledge of MERN and Gatsby/GraphQL

Some losses

- couldn't successfully implement conditional styling on the header navigation
- couldn't successfully size/style images sourced from the Gutenberg editor to fit properly on the archive pages

Next steps

- tackling the losses above
- artwork post type
- live search functionality
